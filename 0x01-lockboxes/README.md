# 0x01. Lockboxes

### Must Know
For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Here’s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:

### Concepts Needed:
###### 1. Lists and List Manipulation:
- Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
- Python Lists (Python Official Documentation)

###### 2. Graph Theory Basics:
- Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.
- Graph Theory (Khan Academy)

###### 3. Algorithmic Complexity:
- Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.
- Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)

###### 3. Recursion:
- Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
- Recursion in Python (Real Python)

###### 4. Queue and Stack:
- Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.
- Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)

###### 5. Set Operations:
- Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
- Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)

### Interview Question

You have n number of locked boxes in front of you. Each box is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each box may contain keys to the other boxes.

Write a method that determines if all the boxes can be opened.

- *Prototype: def canUnlockAll(boxes)*
- *boxes is a list of lists*
- *A key with the same number as a box opens that box*
- *You can assume all keys will be positive integers*
- *There can be keys that do not have boxes*
- *The first box boxes[0] is unlocked*
- *Return True if all boxes can be opened, else return False*

#### Example
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3

canUnlockAll = __import__('0-lockboxes').canUnlockAll

boxes = [[1], [2], [3], [4], []]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))

boxes = [[1, 4, 6], [2], [0, 4, 1], [5, 6, 2], [3], [4, 1], [6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))

boxes = [[1, 4], [2], [0, 4, 1], [3], [], [4, 1], [5, 6]]
print(canUnlockAll(boxes))
